<h2>Main Learnings</h2>

  <h3>1. Learning</h3>

  <h3>2. Form Tools</h3>
  <ul><p>I worked with data validation using JavaScript and saved them into a database with PHP. I also used new tools like "hover" and "grid".</p></ul>
  
  <h3>3. Responsive Design</h3>
  <ul><p>I applied modern CSS practices to ensure a good experience across different screen sizes. I also learned how to divide two elements inside a main container, which was used on the "Home" screen.</p></ul>

  <h3>4. Database</h3>
  <ul><p>I was able to send form data using PHP to an SQL database, as well as load and edit this data.</p></ul>
